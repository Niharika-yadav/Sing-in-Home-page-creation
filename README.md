# Sing-in-Home-page-creation

## **Description**
A simple user authentication interface developed using Python. It features user input validation, error handling for incorrect credentials, and a focus on security. This project is a foundational component for systems requiring secure user access.

## Overview
Using only Python, I created a sign-in page by designing a user interface that captures username and password inputs, and implemented backend logic to validate these credentials. The credentials were securely stored in a local file or database, with passwords encrypted for security. Upon successful authentication, the user is granted access to the system, while unsuccessful attempts trigger error messages.
