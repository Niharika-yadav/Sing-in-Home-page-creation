# Sing-in-Home-page-creation

## **Description**
A simple user authentication interface developed using Python. It features user input validation, error handling for incorrect credentials, and a focus on security. This project is a foundational component for systems requiring secure user access.

## Overview
Using only Python, I created a sign-in page by designing a user interface that captures username and password inputs, and implemented backend logic to validate these credentials. The credentials were securely stored in a local file or database, with passwords encrypted for security. Upon successful authentication, the user is granted access to the system, while unsuccessful attempts trigger error messages.

## Libraries Used
- **Tkinter**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI) to capture username and password inputs.
- **PLi (Python Library Interface)**: For advanced form handling or integrating with other systems, if applicable.
- **AST (Abstract Syntax Trees)**: For parsing and analyzing Python code or configurations, which could be useful if you're dealing with dynamic code execution or custom validation rules.

### Requirments for run Sing in file.

**Username - admin**
**Password - 1234**
